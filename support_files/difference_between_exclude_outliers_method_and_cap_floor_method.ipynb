    "In above `Exclude Outliers Method` we used threshold of `lower_bound` and `upper_bound`. Using the same `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` values for flooring and capping would indeed bring the outliers to the same threshold values used for exclusion in the previous method. However, the key difference with flooring and capping is that you retain all data points, adjusting extreme values to the threshold, rather than removing them entirely from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the flooring and capping method distinct and perhaps more meaningful, you might consider using different criteria for determining the floor and cap values. For instance, you could use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A specific percentile, such as the 1st percentile for the floor and the 99th percentile for the cap.\n",
    "- A fixed value determined by domain knowledge or other criteria that make sense for your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of the flooring and capping approach is that by overwriting the outlier values with the `lower_bound` and `upper_bound`, you retain the data points in your dataset but limit their influence by setting extreme values to more reasonable, predefined thresholds. This way, the overall distribution is less affected by extreme outliers, which can be particularly useful in analyses where the presence of outliers could skew the results, but where it's also important to maintain the same sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintaining the same sample size by adjusting rather than removing outliers can be important in several situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Statistical Power**: In statistical hypothesis testing, the power of a test (the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis) often increases with the sample size. By keeping all data points, you maintain the statistical power of your tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Training**: In machine learning, more data can lead to better model training, as the model has more examples to learn from. Removing outliers might reduce the dataset size significantly, especially in datasets with many outliers, potentially weakening the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Representativeness**: In some cases, outliers might not be errors but extreme cases that are part of the natural variability in the data. Retaining these points, albeit with adjusted values, ensures that the dataset remains representative of the entire population, including the tails of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Integrity**: For some analyses, especially in fields like medical research or financial forecasting, it's crucial to maintain data integrity by keeping all records. Adjusting values rather than removing them can help maintain this integrity while mitigating the impact of extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Longitudinal Studies**: In studies that track the same subjects over time, maintaining the same sample size across different time points can be critical for consistency and comparability of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Regulatory Requirements**: In certain regulated industries, there might be requirements to report on all collected data, making it necessary to retain and adjust outliers rather than exclude them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these and similar situations, flooring and capping provide a way to deal with outliers without losing valuable data points, ensuring robust analysis and maintaining the integrity and size of the dataset."

    "The flooring and capping outliers by overwriting their values with predefined thresholds can indeed lead to underestimation or overestimation of those values. This method modifies the actual data points to reduce the impact of extreme outliers on the analysis but at the cost of altering the true values. Here are some considerations regarding this trade-off:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Underestimation and Overestimation**\n",
    "- **Overestimation**: By setting a floor value, values that are naturally lower than this threshold are raised to the floor, potentially overestimating their true value.\n",
    "- **Underestimation**: Similarly, by setting a cap, values naturally higher than this threshold are reduced to the cap, which can underestimate their true value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact on Analysis**\n",
    "- **Reduced Variability**: This method reduces the variability in your data by bringing extreme values closer to the median, which could affect analyses that depend on variance or standard deviation.\n",
    "- **Skewed Insights**: The insights derived from the adjusted data might be skewed since the original distribution and range of the data have been altered. This is particularly relevant in analyses where extreme values are significant, such as risk assessment in finance or identifying rare medical conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Flooring and Capping**\n",
    "Despite these drawbacks, flooring and capping might still be chosen in situations where:\n",
    "- The primary goal is to mitigate the impact of extreme outliers on the overall analysis without losing data points.\n",
    "- The exact values of the extreme outliers are less critical for the analysis or the conclusions drawn from the data.\n",
    "- The dataset has a significant number of outliers, and removing them would lead to a substantial reduction in sample size, affecting the analysis's reliability or statistical power.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternatives**\n",
    "If the potential for underestimation or overestimation is a concern, you might consider alternative methods such as:\n",
    "- **Transformation**: Applying a mathematical transformation (e.g., logarithmic) to reduce skewness and the impact of outliers without altering the data's integrity.\n",
    "- **Robust Statistical Methods**: Using statistical techniques that are less sensitive to outliers, such as median-based statistics or robust regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**  \n",
    "When you overwrite outlier values through flooring and capping, you indeed introduce a form of bias by underestimating or overestimating the true values of these outliers. This adjustment is a trade-off: it reduces the skew and variability introduced by extreme outliers, but it can also distort the original data distribution and potentially mask the true variation within the extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision to use flooring and capping should consider the impact of this bias versus the benefits of reducing outlier influence. It's often chosen when the outliers are deemed to be errors or when their extreme values are not critical to the analysis's objectives. In cases where outliers represent valuable information (e.g., in fraud detection, rare events studies), it might be better to retain these values or use other methods to handle them.\n"
