    "- **Definition:** The IQR is the range within which the central 50% of the data lies, specifically between the 25th percentile (Q1) and the 75th percentile (Q3). It shows the distance between the first and third quartiles (Q3-Q1). A larger box indicates that the middle 50% of the data is more spread out or has a wider range.\n",
    "- **Measure of Spread:** The IQR measures the spread of the middle 50% of your data. It tells you how tightly or widely data points are clustered around the median. A larger IQR indicates greater variability, while a smaller IQR suggests less variability. You can use the IQR to compare the **variability** of two or more datasets. If one dataset has a larger IQR than another, it indicates that the data in the first dataset is more **spread out** or **variable**.\n",
    "- **Given Information:**\n",
    "    - **For Mid-Range:** The IQR is 17.0, calculated as Q3 (55.0) - Q1 (38.0). This tells us that the middle 50% of the prices fall within the range of $55.0$ and $38.0$.\n",
    "    - **For Budget-Friendly:** The IQR is 10.6, calculated as Q3 (24.6) - Q1 (14.0). This tells us that the middle 50% of the prices fall within the range of $24.6$ and $14.0$.\n",
    "- **Explanation:**\n",
    "    - **For Mid-Range:** The IQR provides insights into the variability of the majority of wine prices. The Budget-Friendly category is more consistent with its prices as its IQR of 10.6 is smaller compared to the Mid-Range category. The smaller the IQR, the more consistent the values compared to a bigger IQR, meaning that Mid-Range wines show a wider range of prices within the middle 50% compared to Budget-Friendly wines, suggesting a more concentrated distribution of prices in the Budget-Friendly category.\n",
    "    - **Main Check of Price Distribution:** Mid-Range has a wider spread of prices, while Budget-Friendly is more concentrated."
